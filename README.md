# Go-Org
A CLI to-do tool :)

| :exclamation: Work in Progress |
|--------------------------------|

## Introduction
Mostly a means to a very specific end of mine and also an opportunity to learn `Golang`.

## Dependencies
It simply uses Go's built in libraries. So to be able to compile the project, it is only needed to have `Go` installed on your system
### Arch
```sh
sudo pacman -S go
sudo pacman -S delve # for debugging if needed
```

### Debian-based
```sh
sudo apt install go
```

### Steps
1. `make build`
2. `make install`

### ToDo's
- [ ] implement more modes
- [ ] implement `install` target
