# Go-Org
## Introduction
Little tool written to organize directories in some cool ways. Mostly a means to a very specific end of mine and also an opportunity to learn `Golang`.

## Dependencies
It simply uses Go's built in libraries. So to be able to compile the project, it is only needed to have `Go` installed on your system
### Arch
```
sudo pacman -S go
```

### Debian-based
```sh
sudo apt install go
```

### Steps
1. `make build`
2. `make install`

### ToDo's
- [] implement more modes
- [] implement `install` target
